# Basic-Login-Page
This project is a simple yet modern login page built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for basic form validation. The layout is fully responsive and designed to work across all screen sizes. It's ideal for practicing front-end development basics and understanding how form interactions work on the client side.
